      <span style="color:212020">Digital his growing in scale from a series of projects undertaken by a couple of individuals to institutionally based organizations, with larger budgets and mandates, beyond other factors. How can a group of interested researchers, academic staff, librarians, and other invested stakeholders work together to create such a centre? This half-day workshop will address this question by exploring issues related to scaling operations from the individual to a centre, determining the appropriate organizational model, developing the plan that situates the DH centre in the academic institution’s and other stakeholders’ mandates, communicating to administration to gain support and resources, structuring memorandums of understanding between partners, and other issues. It builds on centerNet’s initiatives to support centre startups with information and tools, which include the DHCenterStartUp listserv and resources page (</span>http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/resources-for-starting-and-sustaining-dh-centers/ 
      <span style="color:212020">). It also complements community building courses offered at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (dhsi.org) and at its training network partners. </span>
