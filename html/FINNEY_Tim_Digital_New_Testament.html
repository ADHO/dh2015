    <p>This workshop proposes to have four presentations on the topic of ‘Digital New Testament’. Application of computer technology to the Bible and particularly the New Testament has a long and illustrious history. New Testament researchers continue to make substantial contributions to digital humanities. Examples include</p>
    <p>• The pioneering work of Vinton Dearing (http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/inmemoriam/vintonadamsdearing.htm).</p>
    <p>• The INTF’s Virtual Manuscript Room (http://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/).</p>
    <p>• The Codex Sinaiticus site (http://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/).</p>
    <p>The New Testament presents a unique challenge to digital humanists. The volume and scope of its primary documents test many approaches to essential tasks, such as transcription and collation of manuscripts (there are tens of thousands of them if translations are included), analysis of textual relationships (the number of texts and complex textual histories break conventional approaches to establishing an initial text), and establishing a critical text (again, complex textual histories frustrate the process; the volume of witnesses requires selection of a mere sample of textual representatives for hand editions).</p>
    <p>Approaches to alleviating some of the manifold problems presented by the New Testament textual tradition will be presented at the proposed workshop:</p>
    <p>• Phylogenetic analysis of textual variation in order to better understand relationships between witnesses (Stephen Carlson).</p>
    <p>• ‘Towards an Open-Ended New Testament? Digital Materiality, Critical Editions, and categories of Ancient Christian Texts’ (Claire Clivaz).</p>
    <p>• Computer simulation of textual transmission to better understand textual development and use of distance-based analysis methods to map the textual landscape (Tim Finney).</p>
    <p>• Generally applicable collation algorithms to produce the fundamental information required for analysis of textual relationships (Desmond Schmidt).</p>
    <p>Relevance to the Digital Humanities Community</p>
    <p>The digital analysis techniques proposed to be presented at the workshop are directly applicable to textual criticism of other corpora (e.g., Homer). Digital techniques that work with the New Testament have already passed a severe test due to the diversity and volume of the material. The techniques are therefore unlikely to be (completely) derailed when applied to other corpora.</p>

    <p>
      <span style="font-style:italic">Stephen Carlson</span>
      <span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>Stephen.Carlson@acu.edu.au 
      <span style="font-weight:bold">)—</span>Research interests include New Testament textual criticism, synoptic source criticism, editing the Fragments of Papias of Hierapolis, formation of the New Testament canon. Areas of expertise include textual criticism, scholarly editing, Koine Greek pragmatics, cladistic analysis, computer programming, including heuristic search techniques such as simulated annealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-style:italic">Claire Clivaz</span>
      <span style="font-weight:bold">(</span>claire.clivaz@unil.ch; https://unil.academia.edu/ClaireClivaz) 
      <span style="font-weight:bold">—</span>Assistant professor of New Testament and early Christian literature at the Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies of the University of Lausanne (2008–2014). She received a Ph.D. in theology from the University of Lausanne on the topic ‘L’ange et la sueur de sang (Lc 22,43–44) ou comment on pourrait bien encore écrire l’histoire’ at the University of Lausanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-style:italic">Timothy J. Finney</span> (tjf@tfinney.net; http://tfinney.net) 
      <span style="font-weight:bold">—</span>Research interests include the text of the New Testament and statistical analysis of New Testament textual variation data. Areas of expertise include programming; big data approaches to digital corpora (e.g. http://founders.archives.gov/, of which he was lead programmer); computer-assisted transcription, collation, and analysis of the New Testament textual corpus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-style:italic">Desmond Schmidt</span> (desmond.allan.schmidt@gmail.com; 
      <span class="Hyperlink">http://ecdosis.net)—</span>His research interests are in the building of general tools for creating and publishing digital scholarly editions. This includes tools for generating multi-version documents, which are an idealised form of works that exist in multiple versions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight:bold">Description of Target Audience</span>
    </p>
    <p>The target audience is people with an interest in digital resources applicable to collation and analysis of textual corpora with a view to producing critical editions.</p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight:bold">Expected Number of Participants</span>
    </p>
    <p>About 30 participants is not unrealistic given the number of digital humanists interested in computer applications relevant to reconstruction of the history and text of various corpora.</p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight:bold">Special Requirements for Technical Support</span>
    </p>
    <p>These items will be required:</p>
    <p>• A projector with VGA and DVI connectors. (Some presenters will use programs run on their own computer using custom software.)</p>
    <p>• A computer workstation that can be connected to the projector in case a presenter wants to load a presentation from a USB stick. Internet connection to the workstation is desirable.</p>
    <p>• Wi-Fi access for presenters who want to access the Internet during their presentations.</p>
    <p>
