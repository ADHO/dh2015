    <p>Comparing witnesses of a text is an important part of scholarly editing. Collation is regarded as one of the scholarly primitives (Unsworth, 2000). Comparing texts by hand can be tedious and prone to error, and it can be made more efficient and reliable with the assistance of computers. This workshop will explain how to use the open-source CollateX 
      <sup>1</sup> collation tool to compare witness of a texts automatically, in a way that can be used to produce critical textual editions and other types of comparative documents. Attendees will learn how to prepare source materials in any language (including those that use non-Latin scripts and directionality that is not left-to-right) for collation, how to perform automated collation using CollateX, and how to edit the results.

    <p>
      <span style="font-weight:bold">Target Audience</span>
    </p>
    <p>Scholars who are interested in using tools to facilitate humanities research, especially with respect to preparing digital critical editions. Participants who wish to work with their own materials will need to bring them (in plain text or TEI markup); the organizers will provide sample data that can be used by participants who do not have their own project materials. Participants are strongly encouraged to install Python 3 and CollateX in preparation for the workshop; the workshop organizers will provide installation instructions in advance. No prior Python programming experience is required. Based on prior workshop experience, we anticipate attracting between 15 and 30 participants. </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight:bold">Special Requirements for Technical Support </span>
    </p>
    <p>A computer projector (HDMI or VGA) will be required for the presentation. Participants will be required to bring their laptops, and the room will need to provide sufficient plug-in electrical connections and wireless Internet connectivity for all participants. </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight:bold">Intended Length and Format of the Workshop </span>
    </p>
    <p>Full day, two sessions. </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-style:italic">Session 1. 9:00–12:00: The Basics of Automatic Collation</span>
    </p>
    <p>The first session will cover the theory of collation, the basics of using CollateX, and the collation of plain text data. No prior experience with collation tools is required. </p>
    <p>• Introduction to the theory and uses of collation. </p>
    <p>• The collation data model: witnesses, tokens, and tokenization.</p>
    <p>• Installing, configuring, and testing CollateX.</p>
    <p>• Collating plain text strings and files.</p>
    <p>• Output options and postprocessing.</p>
    <p>• Introduction to normalization.</p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-style:italic">Session 2. 13:00–16:00: Collating XML (including TEI) Data </span>
    </p>
    <p>The second session will cover more advanced topics, most notably the collation of transcriptions that contain XML (including TEI) markup. </p>
    <p>• The collation data model with XML (especially TEI) input. </p>
    <p>• Advanced normalization. </p>
    <p>• Recognizing and tracking markup information during collation. </p>
    <p>• Processing tokens differently according to markup information. </p>
    <p>• Output options and post processing for XML (especially TEI) output. </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight:bold">Call for Participation</span>
    </p>
    <p>We asked applicants on relevant mailing lists (such as Humanist, TEIL, Digital Medievalist) to tell us about their interests, needs, and prior experience with respect to collation. The instructors listed above will serve as the workshop program committee. For participants, up to 30 participants were to be accepted. </p>
