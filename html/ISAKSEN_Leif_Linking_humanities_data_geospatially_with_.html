    <p>After the initial burst of investment in the digitization of humanities resources, more recent work in the digital humanities has begun to address the problem of siloed information by bridging heterogeneous and independently maintained datasets. One such approach is Linked Open Data, which has given rise to an emerging and diverse ecology of projects, collectively building the digital foundations for new modes of discovery, analysis, and representation (Elliott, 2014). The potentially unlimited number of resources to which this methodology is suited means that establishing a healthy community of practice is essential in order for it to scale. This workshop offers a hands-on introduction to the theory and practice of Linked Open Data in the humanities through the framework of the Pelagios project.</p>
    <p>Pelagios is an award-winning multi-year initiative—funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, JISC, and the AHRC—that is semantically linking a large corpus of geospatial documents from Latin, Greek, European medieval and maritime, as well as early Islamic and Chinese traditions. For this purpose we have developed 
      <span style="font-style:italic">Recogito</span>, an open-source online platform for associating place references in maps and texts with URI-based gazetters of historical places (GPL v.3 licensed source code hosted at 
      <a class="link_ref" href="http://github.com/pelagios/recogito"> </a>http://pelagios.org/recogito/documentation). 
      <span style="font-style:italic">Recogito</span> has been under development for almost two years and is a fully functioning toolkit for annotation that draws upon the maturing ecosystem of digital gazetteers for classical and post-classical eras. Sources already in 
      <span style="font-style:italic">Recogito</span> include Herodotus’ 
      <span style="font-style:italic">Histories</span>, Roman itineraries, portolan charts, mappae mundi, accounts of pilgrimages to Jerusalem, and al-Muqaddasi’s description of the Islamic world.
    </p>
    <p>The workshop will demonstrate how geospatial data can be created from humanities sources, whether textual or cartographic, and re-purposed in a variety of ways. The workshop will comprise four short (45-min.) sessions:</p>
    <p class="List Paragraph">1. A short tutorial introducing the project along with the basic goals and practices of annotating materials with 
      <span style="font-style:italic">Recogito</span>, including principles that can be extended to a wide variety of other historical entities such as people and events.
    </p>
    <p class="List Paragraph">2. A practical session dedicated to creating semantic geo-annotations by using a visual tool to mark up place references in a wide range of pre-modern maps, itineraries, and geographic descriptions.</p>
    <p class="List Paragraph">3. A hands-on session devoted to ‘georesolution’, associating the annotations with an entry in an online gazetteer.</p>
    <p class="List Paragraph">4. The final session will provide concrete examples by which participants can make use of the data they and others have created, either through the use of Pelagios’ sophisticated API, or as a CSV file that can be visualised or analysed in GIS or a spreadsheet, and encourage participants to reflect on the application of these approaches to their own work.</p>
    <p>The tools and methods will continue to be available to participants after the workshops, allowing them to make use of 
      <span style="font-style:italic">Recogito</span> for their own needs.
    </p>
    <p class="heading 3">Description of Target Audience and Expected Number of Participants</p>
    <p>This workshop will appeal to anyone seeking practical approaches to Linked Open Data with low barriers to entry and well-defined benefits, and conversely, anyone interested in new developments in spatial technologies. We particularly welcome those with an interest in semantically annotating their own content so that it can draw on and contribute to the developing Linked Data ecosystem. (Participants wishing to do so should contact the organisers in advance.) We will be able to support a maximum of 30 participants. No previous knowledge of geospatial or semantic technologies is required.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the Andrew W. Mellon foundation and a DM2E/OKFN Open Humanities Award, Pelagios has already run three highly successful workshops about 
      <span style="font-style:italic">Recogito</span> at Tufts University, the University of Heidelberg, and the University of Applied Science Mainz. In addition to this, an emerging community of contributors has formed around 
      <span style="font-style:italic">Recogito</span>, focussing on particular areas of content and improving usability through their feedback. On this basis we are confident that participants will both gain practical experience and find the workshop intellectually stimulating.
